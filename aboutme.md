I live in Portland and I work at Nike doing Analytics work. I enjoy rock climbing, video games, meeting new people. For work, I am curious and passionate about ways to leverage data to make a difference. 

### my history

I went to school at UC Berkeley. Worked in the education sector, then healthcare for a short bit, and now i'm working in logistics.
